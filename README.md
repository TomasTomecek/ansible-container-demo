# Ansible Container Demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ansible/ansible-container-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ansible/ansible-container-demo)

[Ansible Container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container) can manage the lifecycle of an application from development through cloud deployment. To demonstrate, we'll create, test and deploy a new social media application called *Not Google Plus*.

The application comes from a [tutorial](https://thinkster.io/django-angularjs-tutorial), but not to worry, this isn't a programming exercise. Instead, we'll focus on how to use Ansible Container at each phase.  

## Requirements

Before continuing, you'll need a couple of things:

 - A Linux or OSX environment  
 - Surprise, surprise, you need to have Ansible Container installed. See our *[Installation guide](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container/installation.html#getting-ansible-container)* for assistance. Be sure to install *docker* engine support, and *openshift* engine support.  
 - Docker Engine or Docker for Mac. See [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for assistance.
 - [Ansible 2.3+](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html)

## Getting Started

Ansible Container uses Ansible roles to build images, initialize projects, and add services to existing projects. You can find roles contributed and maintained by the community at [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com).

Keep in mind, there are three different types of roles. There are standard roles that simply execute tasks, which we can use with Ansible Container to build images. Container App roles can be used to initialize an Ansible Container project, and Container Enabled roles define a service that can be added to an existing project.  

To initialize our project we'll use the Container App role, *[ansible.django-gulp-nginx](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ansible/django-gulp-nginx)*. We'll start by creating an empty project directory, setting the new directory as the working directory, and then running the `init` command to copy the full contents of the role into the directory. This particular role will give us a fully functioning Django framework. 

Go ahead and initialize a new project called *demo* by opening a terminal session, and executing the following commands:

```
# Create an empty directory called 'demo'
$ mkdir demo

# Set the working directory to demo
$ cd demo

# Initialize the project
$ ansible-container init ansible.django-gulp-nginx
``` 

The following video shows the project init steps:

[![Project Init](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible-container-demo/gh-pages/images/init.png)](https://youtu.be/UTUBO7JHxWM)

You now have a copy of the *ansible.django-gulp-nginx* framework project in your *demo* directory. Among the files added to the directory, you'll find a `container.yml` file describing the services that make up the application, a `roles` directory containing custom roles used to services, and all the supporting source files that make up the framework project.

### Build the Images

The `container.yml` file defines four services: *django, gulp, nginx, and postgresql*. Before we can use the services, and begin application development, we need to build the images. Start the build process by running the following command:

```
# Set the working directory to demo
$ cd demo 

# Start the image build process
$ ansible-container build
```

[![Build Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible-container-demo/gh-pages/images/build.png)](https://youtu.be/J6SMRomTCxY)

For each service that has a set of roles in `container.yml`, the process executes the roles to build the service. It does this by starting the Conductor container, and starting a container for the service. It then executes the Ansible roles one at time. For each role, it generates a playbook to execute the role. It runs the playbook on the Conductor container, and executes role tasks against the service container.

After each role finishes, a snapshot is taken of the service container, and committed as a new image layer. Together, the complete set of layers forms the image for the service.

When the build completes, run the `docker images` command to view a list of local images. The output will include the following images:

```bash
# View the images
$ docker images

```

### Run the Application

Now that you have the application images built in your environment, start the application by running the following:

```bash
# Start the application
$ ansible-container run
```

The containers are now running in the background. The *gulp* service proxies requests to the *django* service. But before it can be accessed, it first has to install *node* and *bower* packages required by the frontend, and then start the web server. 

Check its progress by running the following to watch the service's log output:

```bash
# Tail the log for the gulp service
$ docker logs -f demo_gulp_1
```

Once you see the following in the log output, the web service is running and accessible:

```
[17:05:29] Starting 'js'...
[BS] Access URLs:
 -----------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:8080
    External: http://172.21.0.4:8080

          UI: http://localhost:3001
 UI External: http://172.21.0.4:3001

[17:05:30] Finished 'templates' after 685 ms
[17:05:30] Finished 'js' after 631 ms
``` 
 
To access the server, open a browser, and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you'll see the default "Hello World!" page.

### Development vs Production

The containers are currently running in *development* mode, which means that for each service the *dev_overrides* directive takes precedence. For example, take a look at the *gulp* service definition found in `container.yml`:

```
gulp:
  from: 'centos:7'
  roles:
    - role: gulp-static
  working_dir: '{{ NODE_HOME }}'
  command: ['/bin/false']
  environment:
    NODE_HOME: '{{ NODE_HOME }}'
  dev_overrides:
    entrypoint: [/entrypoint.sh]
    command: [/usr/bin/dumb-init, /usr/local/bin/gulp]
    ports:
      - '8080:{{ GULP_DEV_PORT }}'
      - 3001:3001
    links:
      - django
    volumes:
      - '$PWD:{{ NODE_HOME }}'
  openshift:
    state: absent
```

In development, *dev_overrides* takes precedence, so the command `/usr/bin/dumb-init /usr/local/bin/gulp` will be executed, ports `8080` and `3001` will be exposed, and the container will be linked to the *django* service container.

The application can be started in production mode, by running `ansible-container run --production`. In production the *dev_overrides* directive is completely ignored, which means the `/bin/false` command is executed, causing the container to immediately stop. No ports are exposed, and the container is not linked to the *django* service.

Since the frontend tools provided by the *gulp* service are only needed during development and not during production, we use *dev_overrides* to manage when the container runs.

The same is true for the *nginx* service. Take a look at the service definition in `container.yml`, and you'll notice it's configured opposite of the *gulp* service:

```
nginx:
  from: 'centos:7'
  roles:
    - role: ansible.nginx-container
      ASSET_PATHS:
        - /tmp/dist
      PROXY: yes
      PROXY_PASS: 'http://django:8080'
      PROXY_LOCATION: "~* /(admin|api)"
  ports:
    - '{{ DJANGO_PORT }}:8000'
  links:
    - django
  dev_overrides:
    ports: []
    command: /bin/false
```

In development the *nginx* service runs the `/bin/false` command, and immediately exits. But in production, it starts the *nginx* process, and takes the place of the *gulp* service as the application's web server.

### Developing the Application

Let's make some updates, and create the *Not Google Plus* app, and then we'll see how to test and deploy it. To make the changes, run the following commands to download the source code, and update the project:

```
# Set the working directory to your *demo* folder
$ cd demo

# Stop the application
$ ansible-container stop

# Download and expand the source archive
$ curl -L https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container-demo/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz | tar -xzv

# Copy the frontend files
$ cp -R ansible-container-demo-0.1.0/src/* src

# Copy the Django files
$ cp -R ansible-container-demo-0.1.0/project/* project

# Restart the application
$ ansible-container run
```

Check the *gulp* service log using the `docker logs -f demo_gulp_1` command, and once the web server is running, the 
*Not Google Plus* application will be available. If you open your browser, and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), you'll see that the "Hello World!" page has been replaced by our social media site.

### Tour the Site 

Let's check out *Not Google Plus*. Watch the video below, and follow along on your local site to register, log in, and create posts. Your site will be reachable at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and you can browse the API directly at [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/).

## Testing

Now that you made changes to the application by adding the code for *Not Google Plus*, you'll need to build a new set of images that contain the updated source code, before moving on to testing and deployment.

Run the following to stop the containers, and then start the build process. This time, use the `--no-container-cache` option on the  `build` command to force the rebuild of each image, and insure that the new source code gets picked up. 

```
# Stop the running containers
$ ansible-container stop 

# Start the build process
$ ansible-container build --no-container-cache
```  

Once the build process completes, take a look at the local images using `docker images`:

```
# View the images once again
$ docker images

```

There's a new set of images containing the updated code. Now when you deploy the application to production, you'll be deploying the *Not Google Plus* app.

For testing, we want the application in *production mode*, so that it runs exactly the same as it will when deployed to the cloud. As we pointed out earlier, when run in production the *dev_overrides* settings are ignored, which means we'll see the *gulp* service stop and the *nginx* service start.

To start the application in production mode, run the following command:

```
# Start the application with the production option
$ ansible-container run --production
```

If we were running a CI/CD process, this is the point where we would run our automated testing scripts. In lieu of that, open a browser, and once again go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to confirm the site is working as expected.

[![Testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible-container-demo/gh-pages/images/production.png)](https://youtu.be/rXJW5JoWTl4) 

## Deploy the application

Once the application passes testing, it's time to deploy it. To demonstrate, we'll create a local instance of OpenShift, and run the `deploy` command to push images and generate a deployment playbook.

### Create a local OpenShift instance

To run the deployment, you'll need access to an OpenShift instance. The [Install and Configure Openshift](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container/configure_openshift.html) guide at our doc site provides a how-to that will help you create a containerized instance.

[Minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift) is a virtual machine that hosts a Docker daemon, and a containerized OpenShift cluster. The following demonstrates creating a [minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift) instance by running the Ansible role, [chouseknecht.minishift-up-role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/chouseknecht/minishift-up-role):

[![Creating an OpenShift instance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible-container-demo/gh-pages/images/cluster.png)](https://youtu.be/UqGdqJf3iFc)

To use the role, you'll need Ansible installed. Also, note in the video that the playbook is copied from the installed role's file structure. You'll find the playbook, *minishift-up.yml*, in the *files* directory.
 
### Create an OpenShift project

Now that you have an OpenShift instance, run the following to make sure you're logged into the cluster as the *developer* user, and create a *demo* project:

```bash
# Verify that we're logged in as the *developer* user
$ oc whoami
developer

# Create a demo project
$ oc new-project demo
```

**Note**
> When you run the `deploy` command, it will attempt to authenticate to the registry using `docker login`, which will check for an existing credential in `${HOME}/.docker/config.json`. If there is an existing entry in this file for the local OpenShift cluster, you'll need to remove it, if the token has expired. Also, you'll need to remove it if the entry points to a key store. Key stores cannot be accessed from within the Conductor container, where the authentication with the registry will actually take place.

The project name is defined in `container.yml`. Within the *settings* section, you will find a *k8s_namespace* directive that sets the name. The project name is arbitrary. However, before running the `deploy` command, the project must already exist, and the user you're logged in as must have access to it.

The reason for creating the project first is because the `deploy` process will attempt to push images to the local registry using the project name as the namespace. If the project does not already exist, then the push will fail. 

### Run the deployment 
 
Next, use the `deploy` command to push the project images to the local registry, and create the deployment playbook. For demonstration purposes, we're referencing the *local_openshift* registry defined in `container.yml`. Depending on how you created the local OpenShift cluster, you may need to adjust the registry attributes.

One of the registry attributes is *namespace*. For OpenShift and K8s, the registry *namespace* should match the *name* value set in *k8s_namespace* within the *settings* section. In the case of OpenShift, the *name* in *k8s_namespace* will be the *project* name, and for K8s, it's the *Namespace*. 

Once you're ready to push the images, run the following from the root of the *demo* project directory:

```bash
# Push the built images and generate the deployment playbook
$ ansible-container --engine openshift deploy --push-to local_openshift --username developer --password $(oc whoami -t)
```

The above will authenticate to the registry using the `developer` username, and a token generated by the `oc whoami -t` command. This presumes that your cluster has a `developer` account, and that you previously authenticated to the cluster with this account.

After pushing the images, a playbook is generated and written to the `ansible-deployment` directory. The name of the playbook will match the project name, and have a `.yml` extension. In this case, the name of the playbook will be `demo.yml`.

You will also find a `roles` directory containing the `ansible.kubernetes-modules` role. The deployment playbook relies on this role for access to the Ansible Kubernetes modules.

To deploy the application, execute the playbook, making sure to include the appropriate tag. Possible tags include: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, and `destroy`. To start the application, run the following:

```bash
# Run the deployment playbook
$ ansible-playbook ./ansible-deployment/demo.yml --tags start
```
Once the playbook completes, log into the OpenShift console to check the status of the deployment. From the *Applications* menu, choose *Routes*, and find the URL that points to the *nginx* service. Using this URL, you can access the appication running on the cluster.
